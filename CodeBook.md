## Code Book for the Course Project
1. The field `subject` denotes the subject that performed an activity represented by a unique number. There are 30 in all.
2. The second field `activity` denotes the activity performed by the subject. There are six types of activites here:

* WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* SITTING
* STANDING
* LAYING

3. Rest of the fields are means of the set of data collected from the original dataset for each subject and activity. Only the fields containing `mean` or `std` in the name were retained. The column names correspond to the name of the original measurement feture, simplified by converting to lower case, removing dashes and brackets and changing the prefixes `t` and `f` to `time` and `frequency` respectively.  The original dataset and its description are found at:[UCI HAR Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Smartphone-Based+Recognition+of+Human+Activities+and+Postural+Transitions "UCI HAR Dataset")
